# blinkinch

Square inch clone of the blink(1) indicator light with ATTiny85 and V-USB.

Created to participate in the [Square Inch Project](https://hackaday.io/project/7813-the-square-inch-project). The design goal was to make something somewhat useful (a programmable indicator light) that is very easy to reproduce (with minimal, common, through-hole parts).
